Python installed on your machine
Requests library installed (pip install requests)
Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Follow the prompts to enter the initial currency, target currency, and amount.
The script will make a request to the Fixer API and display the conversion result.
API Key
The script uses the Fixer API to retrieve currency conversion rates. To use the API, you need to obtain an API key from Fixer. Replace the placeholder API key in the script with your own API key.
