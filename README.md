# Currency Conversion Script


##### This script allows you to convert currencies using the Fixer API. It takes the initial currency, target currency, and amount as inputs and retrieves the conversion rate using the API.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

* Python installed on your machine
* Requests library installed (`pip install requests`)

# Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script by executing the following command: python currency_conversion.py
4. Follow the prompts to enter the initial currency, target currency, and amount.
5. The script will make a request to the Fixer API and display the conversion result.

# API Key

#### The script uses the Fixer API to retrieve currency conversion rates. To use the API, you need to obtain an API key from Fixer. Replace the placeholder API key in the script with your own API key.

```bash
headers = {
    "apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```

# Error Handling

If there is an error in the API response or if the input values are invalid, the script will display an error message and exit.
